# Fair Use Specs

Sahamati will implement the following additional APIs that can be used by FIUs & AAs to retrieve data such as Consent Template definitions, FIU profile and Fair Use Policy rules which are required to validate the consent request (i.e. execute the policy rules) and take necessary action.

* **Fair Use Parameters API**
  * APIs to list or get definitions of purpose codes and the fair use parameters for each purpose code
* **Fair Use Policies API**
  * APIs to fetch the policy rules for Consent and FI requests. The same API will be used for other policies (in future).
