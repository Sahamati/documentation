# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is the SahamatiNet Router, and what role does it play in the Account Aggregator (AA) ecosystem?**

* The SahamatiNet Router is a network service that streamlines and secures interactions between Financial Information Providers (FIPs), Account Aggregators (AAs), and Financial Information Users (FIUs). By routing communication, it reduces the complexity of multiple integrations, ensuring interoperability as well as efficient and secure data exchange.

**Q: How does the SahamatiNet Router enhance integration, collaboration, and the AA Ecosystem ?**

* The SahamatiNet Router streamlines interactions between FIPs, AAs, and FIUs by providing a standardised interface, eliminating the need for custom integrations. It simplifies data exchange, improves collaboration between participants, and handles backend operations like traffic routing and load balancing. This allows AAs to focus on enhancing their services and delivering a better customer experience.

**Q: How does observability in the SahamatiNet Router benefit participants?**

* The Network SahamatiNet Router offers real-time observability, providing insights into API call frequency, response times, and error rates. This helps participants monitor system performance, diagnose issues, and optimise their infrastructure for better operational efficiency.

**Q: How does the SahamatiNet Router handle scalability as the AA ecosystem grows?**

* The SahamatiNet Router is designed with scalability in mind, capable of handling increased traffic and participants as the ecosystem expands. Its architecture supports horizontal scaling to ensure continued high performance and availability.

**Q: What is the purpose of the sandbox environment provided by the SahamatiNet Router?**

* The sandbox environment allows participants to test their integrations in a risk-free setting that mimics real-world conditions. It enables FIPs, AAs, and FIUs to validate system functionality and troubleshoot issues before transitioning to the production environment.
* Do note, the Sandbox is independent of UAT and Production environments of SahamatiNet.
