# Validation of Integration

For the POC integration, there are two key validation steps to be completed:

1. **Validation with Simulators**: The first step involves validating your Application/APIs with the respective simulators based on your Entity Type. If you are an FIU, you will test the integration with the AA Simulator. If you are an AA, you will validate with both the FIU and FIP Simulators. If you are an FIP, you will validate with the AA Simulator. This ensures that all APIs are functioning correctly and the response codes align with the ReBIT Specification Response Codes.
2. **Validation with REs:** The second step occurs once other respective REs (Registered Entities) have onboarded and completed their validation with the simulators. You will then test your integration with these REs to ensure that your application works seamlessly with other participants in the ecosystem.

The Sahamati team will share the list of test cases for API testing based on the ReBIT specification. We will collaborate with you to evolve these test cases throughout the POC, refining and improving them to ensure they comprehensively cover all aspects of the integration and make the process more streamlined and effective.

In both of these validation steps, you are required to share the results with the Sahamati team as evidence to confirm that the integration meets the necessary standards.

More details on these validations will be provided as we progress through the POC.
