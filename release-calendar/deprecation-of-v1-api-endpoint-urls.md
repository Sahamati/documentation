# Deprecation of V1 API Endpoint URLs

This is to inform all participants of the Account Aggregator (AA) ecosystem about the deprecation of the ReBIT API V1 in the Central Registry and the necessary steps for transitioning to the V2 API.

### Key Updates:

* **Deprecation of ReBIT API V1:**\
  As per the notification from ReBIT on 12th May 2024, the ReBIT V1 API has been officially deprecated. All ecosystem participants, including FIPs, FIUs, and AAs, must complete their transition to the ReBIT V2 API by 30th June 2024.
* **For Participants Using V1:**\
  You are required to update your API Endpoint URLs to V2 in the Central Registry. Please share your V2 endpoint details with the Sahamati Services team.
* **For Participants Supporting Both V1 and V2:**\
  To ensure a smooth transition, it is recommended to deprecate the V1 endpoint URL by updating it to **/v1/nonexistent-resource** in the Central Registry. This will signal to users that the V1 endpoint is no longer valid, ensuring they switch to V2 seamlessly.
* **Best Practices:**\
  As a best practice, participants should refresh the Entities Endpoint URL from the Central Registry daily. This ensures that any updates made by other participants transitioning to V2 are reflected in your system, helping avoid miscommunication or errors.

### Implementation Timelines:

* The ReBIT V1 API deadline has already passed. Participants must ensure that their V1 API Base URLs are updated in the Central Registry to V2 to avoid disruptions.

### Action Required:

* **Update your Base URLs**\
  Please reach out to **services@sahamati.org.in** to update your application Endpoint Base URLs from V1 to V2 in the Central Registry.
