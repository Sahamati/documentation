**Update on Client Secret Rotation:**

Based on the UAT feedback regarding client secret rotation, we will be updating the validity period for newly generated tokens to 180 days. As a result, the planned deployment, **originally scheduled for 3rd October 2024, has been deployed on 16th October 2024**, following the next round of UAT.

The next release will also include changes that allow entities to parameterise and configure the expiry period themselves, based on their respective regulatory guidelines.
