The Release Calendar outlines the updates and improvements introduced by Sahamati in the common services provided to the Account Aggregator (AA) ecosystem. It highlights key feature deployments and their scheduled timelines for both UAT and Production environments, enabling participants to stay aligned with regulatory and ecosystem-related enhancements. By adhering to the deployment dates, participants can seamlessly integrate these updates into their own release cycles, ensuring they stay up to date with the evolving changes.
