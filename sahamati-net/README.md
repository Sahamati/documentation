# Sahamati Net

**Sahamati Net** is the technological infrastructure developed and maintained by Sahamati to support the Account Aggregator (AA) ecosystem. It comprises a set of specifications, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and services aimed at improving the ecosystem's performance, trust, and reliability. By establishing a robust infrastructure, Sahamati Net addresses key challenges such as interoperability, data compliance, data quality, and operational efficiency, thereby ensuring a seamless and trustworthy experience for AA ecosystem entities involved.

Below are the current focus areas of Sahamati Net:

* **Interoperability**: Move from the current “bilateral-trust” model to a “network-trust” framework that guarantees interoperability between all members of the AA ecosystem.
* **Fair Use Compliance**: Enable a policy-based automated framework that ensures compliance to fair use of consumer's consent and data in the AA ecosystem.
* **Network Observability**: Digital infrastructure to observe operational & technical aspects of the AA ecosystem, and to discover actionable insights.
