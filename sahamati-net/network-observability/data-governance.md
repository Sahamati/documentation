# Data Governance

In the context of Network Observability, the guiding principles for data governance will be:

* **Data minimization:** Collecting the minimum data necessary to provide an independent view of network growth and health.
* **Privacy by Design:** All data collection for network observability will ensure that data privacy is implemented by design and to the extent feasible, anonymized or pseudonymized data shall be used for computing and reporting network growth and health metrics.
* **Principle of least privilege:** Even though the majority of the data for network observability is expected to have non-identifiable data, in exceptional scenarios where AA or the member has access to any data for computational purposes, the principle of least privilege shall be adopted.
* **Data as a shared asset:** The data submitted by members to enable network observability shall be treated as a shared asset of all members of the AA network and no single entity will have rights or privileges over the Network Observability data.

In line with the above principles, the network observability framework will ensure that minimal, non-identifiable data is utilized to compute and report network health and growth metrics and each stakeholder has the least or minimal set of privileges required to access or view the data. While establishing data governance, Sahamati will also consider various parameters like anonymized personally identifiable information (PII), aggregate, identity-less, non-business sensitive data and confidentiality, to ensure the protection and responsible handling of data.

Further, below data governance components have to be detailed out in the network data policy. This policy will be established during the implementation of Network Observability and may undergo several update cycles following its initial implementation.

* Receiving the data from network participants
* Storing of the data by Sahamati and network participants
* Backup schedules and duration
* Archiving old data
* Purging of expired data
* Sharing of data within and outside the network
