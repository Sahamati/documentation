# Telemetry

Telemetry refers to the automated communication process by which measurements and other data are collected at remote or inaccessible points and then transmitted to receiving equipment for monitoring and analysis. In simpler terms, telemetry involves gathering data from sensors or instruments and transmitting it to a central location for analysis or observation.

Telemetry, particularly in the context of network observability, can help address the outlined requirements in the following ways:

1. **Unified Source of Truth:**
   * Telemetry allows for the collection of real-time data from various network components, providing a consistent and centralized source of information.
   * By aggregating telemetry data from different members, it becomes easier to reconcile discrepancies and establish a unified view of truth through analytics and visualization tools.
2. **Real-Time Access to Data:**
   * Telemetry systems capture and transmit data in real-time, enabling immediate access to critical information for all members.
   * With telemetry, members can monitor network performance metrics, detect anomalies, and respond promptly to issues, thereby improving operational visibility and decision-making.
3. **Sensitivity of Data, Access Control, and Reciprocity:**
   * Telemetry solutions can be designed with built-in security features such as encryption, access controls, and role-based authentication to safeguard sensitive data.
   * Access to telemetry data can be restricted based on predefined permissions and agreements, ensuring that only authorized users with verified identities can access relevant information.
   * Reciprocity can be enforced by making data sharing a prerequisite for accessing shared telemetry insights, promoting collaboration and transparency among members.
4. **Development Efforts and Deployment Cycles:**
   * Telemetry frameworks and platforms often offer standardized interfaces and APIs, simplifying integration and deployment across diverse environments.
   * Modular telemetry architectures allow for easy customization and scalability, accommodating the needs and resources of different members without disrupting existing systems.
   * Telemetry solutions can be deployed incrementally, allowing members to adopt and scale observability capabilities at their own pace while minimizing deployment complexities.

Overall, telemetry plays a crucial role in addressing the requirements of network observability by providing real-time insights, ensuring data privacy and security, and facilitating seamless collaboration among members.
