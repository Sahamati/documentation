# Participant Onboarding

Participants in the Sahamati Buildaathon 2024 hackathon are required to assume the role of an ecosystem member from the Account Aggregator (AA) ecosystem to build innovative financial products and services. To begin this journey, teams must first onboard to the **Sahamati Sandbox environment** as one of the ecosystem members. This sandbox will serve as the platform where they can experiment, test, and bring their innovative ideas to life.

The onboarding process is a crucial step, as it ensures that the participants can simulate real-world AA ecosystem interactions and leverage the available data infrastructure to build their solutions.

## Steps for Onboarding:

#### **1. Select Ecosystem Member Type**

The participating teams need to specify the **type of ecosystem member** they wish to represent. In the AA ecosystem, there are typically four major types of members:

* **Account Aggregators (AA):** Entities that facilitate the secure sharing of user financial data between financial information providers (FIPs) and financial information users (FIUs).
* **Financial Information Providers (FIP):** Entities that hold user financial data, such as banks, NBFCs, etc.
* **Financial Information Users (FIU):** Entities that seek user financial data to provide value-added services like loans, wealth management, and more.

Based on your hackathon projectâ€™s goals and innovation focus, select the most suitable type of ecosystem member to mimic during your development process.

#### 2. Provide Details for Onboarding

After selecting the member type, the participating teams must share details about the ecosystem member they wish to simulate. This includes:

* **Ecosystem Member Type:** Specify whether you are mimicking an AA, FIP, or FIU.
* **Details of the Ecosystem Member:** Outline any specific features, services, or characteristics that define the role you plan to replicate. For example, if you are simulating an FIU, describe the type of financial data services or user needs you intend to focus on.
* **Primary Contact Information:** Share the contact details of the team lead or primary point of contact. This should include their **name** and **email address**, which will be used for communication and support throughout the hackathon.

#### **3. Complete the Onboarding Form**

To officially onboard as an ecosystem member in the hackathon, participants must complete the provided Google form. This form will capture all the necessary details required to set up the team in the Sahamati Sandbox environment. Ensure that all fields are filled accurately to avoid delays in the onboarding process.

You can access the form using the following link:\
